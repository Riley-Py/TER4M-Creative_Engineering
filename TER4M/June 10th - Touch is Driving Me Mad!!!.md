Getting touch to work on a touchscreen should be simple, right?  *Right??* WRONG!  The answer is wrong! I've been following this tutorial on how to do it and tried to make it work with the LVGL version he is using before porting it.  Well, what do I see when I try doing that?  This:

Literally, that is all it is.  Once adding the necessary code, it goes back to the white screen *sigh*.  Well, here's the thing: I have about a week to get this project done, so here is the game plan:

1. I will try this again for a max of two days.  I have other libraries that I could try.
2. After that, I will move on to networking and fetching data from APIs/parsing it
3. If I have time, I will then go back to trying to solve the LCD issue

Goddamn it!  I thought I had this....I underestimated once again.  Lesson learned: Always,*always* overestimate.
