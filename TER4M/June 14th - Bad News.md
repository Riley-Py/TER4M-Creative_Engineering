When I tested the screen with the Arduino UNO, where it usually worked, it had the same glow and artifacting as before.  That means the display is defective and won't be usable.  As well, I didn't notice this, but I tested out the touch, to find that there is a crack on the capactive layer of the screen.  That means that touch doesn't work.  After all of my troubleshooting and trials, the screen now breaks. 

This has forced me to order a new one from Amazon, and (thankfully for using the Prime trial), it will come promptly.  While waiting for that, I will be getting the API stuff working so that I am ready to display that to my screen and create the "Video Game Price Tracker Dashboard".
