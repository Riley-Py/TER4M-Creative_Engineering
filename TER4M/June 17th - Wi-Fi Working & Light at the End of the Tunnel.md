Well, after the entire ordeal with the touchscreen debacle, I wanted to move on to the other main learning point of this project: APIs.  An applicable programmable interface is where you basically fetch secondary data from a remote source that is collecting it and using it for your own project.  

I am making a video game dashboard, where it displays video game information.  Therefore, with using LVGL and the API called [RAWG](https://rawg.io/), then I can display video game information.  If I manage to have enough time, then I will allow user input for the games.  However, the main priority is getting it on the screen.  Here is a photo of it fetching information for a game called "Mass Effect" and reading the data:

As well, today was the day where LVGL and WiFi cooperated, as seen in this video where I am passing parameters to the UI function and it showing up on my screen!

Tomorrow, it's cleanup day.  That means the following:

1. Clean up the code and comment it
2. Make the UI proper and make it look nice and presentable
3. Prepare to answer the questions on Wednesday
Damn, I wish I had more time, or else I would be able to do some crazy things.  However, at least I am accomplishing my original goals of: 

- Learn how a touchscreen works
- Learn how to fetch data from an API
- Displaying it with LVGL
