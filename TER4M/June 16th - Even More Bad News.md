I got my TFT LCD screen from Amazon!  However, when I tested it, it came out to values that weren't recognized and it wasn't running any of the tests that the old one was running.  As well, it was giving different identities for itself, even though it stated on the website that it was a "compatible ILI9486/ILI9488" screen:

So, thankfully with a broken digitizer, my screen still displays.  Therefore, I will be using it solely as a display where it can display the data fetched from the API.  I will make one screen for the data and explain that if I had time to redo this, I would have got a different TFT screen that was simpler to use and wasn't defective.
