When I went into school, my initial plan was that I was going to work on networking features while waiting for an LCD TFT screen that I ordered to ship.  Well, while I was returning the other LCD TFT screen that created so much anguish for me one night, I happened to spot another model of LCD screen that was this [one](https://www.amazon.ca/480x320-Screen-Module-Arduino-Without/dp/B07NWH47PV/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3GKUB29NXMGV2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1YeXmxigKKKtIFK2V35MXORwc3mGrQcbn7cyVRoZzKJvr8MW-cDjf0jS3GAbB4rDGj7mV2VlJ5n_qrEmu_d8Yy557aSUSGuYXVLscwVR7l8tiHVB-YTtO5G56KHfhU7gjYR3Bd6FgPCTvpq5boJPXI0cEUeEBwC4nZpEP-H7HnPX0tziO-HUrp8DoK00Rg84HYZP56DxIjRFXPb9IHo9bTE9MO6fbZ9xzhdZirn9tTljt2bwQgeBIpUhi4t-F6Y46YcdzhpTjuliiEHeBrLoi8oBDJgA7NtTksJ2nX4mmZI.IDbagHtPhgJGz1CVIBXqA8IQj652N89ZPbgJJvXFjTY&dib_tag=se&keywords=tft+lcd+display&qid=1717471618&sprefix=tft+lcd+display%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-6).  It had a different controller (ILI9486 VS. HX8347G) and so there was some chance that it could have worked.  In class, however, I managed to hook up to the school WiFi, as seen below: ![[wifi.jpg]]

Yes!  At least networking operated flawlessly on the ESP32 without a hitch!  Tomorrow is where I will be playing with JSON requests and trying to fetch information.  When I got home, I ran my "MCUfriend" tool to find out what controller was on this LCD.  I got this from running it on my UNO:

This hexcode, when searched up, brings up the ILI9486 without a question, which is a type of controller that TFT_eSPI supports!  I then decided to wire it up to the ESP32 in the following configuration:
![[big_lcd_wiring.jpg]]And, after troubleshooting some issues (more like not corresponding the pins on the LCD to the pins of the ESP32 as laid-out on my user_setup.h file), I ran the "Color test" program and was humbly surprised with the LCD not showing white, but instead a color wheel with the ESP32:

So, now the LCD problem is fixed (and I am going to return the one that I recently ordered).  As well, this a touch-capable screen, so touchscreen functionality is back on the table (yay!). Tomorrow will be playing with JSON parsing and playing with LVGL on the screen (i.e. run a demo and see how it runs).
