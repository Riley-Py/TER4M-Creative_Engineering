# TER4M Creative Engineering
This repository houses the following:

1. My Journal in MD files as I used Obsidian for my notes;
2. My .ino file for this project, commented;

This was for a creative engineering project called "The Videogame Dashboard".

Technologies used: ESP32, Arduino (IDE), C++, LVGL, HTTP/webserver libraries, ESP32 WiFi library, TFT_eSPI library, ILI9486/88 touch screen.

## Conclusion
The major thing that I learned from this project was: Persevere through everything, and take some failures as an experience.  I learned quite a lot from this project, and I quite like what I was able to do with hardware that I didn't really play with before and messing around with libraries that I haven't used before.  As well, documenting everything was a _godsend_, as I was able to track links, images, and videos to reference back on if need be.
